struck multiple nerves, facial expressions like permanent side effects of botox

you can do whatever you want but you can also drink water from lead pipes

words escped my mouth, bares her fangs, acomplished people, yonder and a ritual silence, personal hell

keep polluting the earth until its night everyday

guts in his arms like dirty washing

She said things, they lit up gold in the air, and then they fell to nothing like so much cigarette ash.

his voice was like pure morpheine trailing along jn the eind

this was the cradle of judah

hell was raised to write love on her arms, only for her to wipe it away

HELL WAS TEMPORARALY CLOSED SO THAT HE COULD

i couldnt have expected a finer reception

you are insane
its a good thing i like that

some, remnant of the past that was brought around and served on a high platter

Marie is looking at Edd, like a cat studying something it doesn't recognize

a slight wisp will blow her away

what you want me to open up to you like a flower lambast

flurry

Maybe it was mindgames but they sent out 10 plumbers and engineers all befuddled because oh this is an electric boiler i can only deal with, im just going to grab the bull by the horns

The internet is full of landmines and buried treasure.

The saga continues
